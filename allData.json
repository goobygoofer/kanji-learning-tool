The error appears to stem from a reasonably early form [] in which the ends of the binding have become separated from the sack, thus suggesting the early form of tree/wood. It is not clear whether this is a simple copying error, an attempt to refer to the wooden nature of the pole, or a mistaken interpretation of the elements as sun and tree. In any event, from an early stage 184 was borrowed phonetically to express east. Some scholars feel that it also lent an idea of thrusting through (i.e. the pole through the binding) and thus by extension suggested the sun thrusting up through the horizon, giving dawn and hence east.

On the other hand, neither its early meaning of thumb nail nor its later mean- ings of hundred or white seem obviously relevant, unless white reinforced the idea of silk. It is also possible that thumb lent an idea of principal (as in 1694), to mean principal type from among a variety of aoks. However it seems more likely that there existed a sec- ond prototype for white, the pictograph of an acorn. In any event, the original meaning of 218 was oak tree, now conveyed by an NGU character [] that adds an extra tree. How it came to mean pleasure and music is not clear. ITs complexity suggests it was not merely borrowed for its sound.

[] is almost certainly spread thighs (see also 1103), the plump- ness indicating female thighs, with opening [] 20 added to indicate vagina.

From this point the link with trade seems clear, i.e. the world's oldest trade of prostitution. A number of authorative Japanese scholars, however, while accepting that [] is vagina, take [] to be used purely phonetically to express birth, giving opening in female thighs that gives birth and thus reinforcing the meaning vagina. That is, they feel that 317 meant simply vagina and not copulation, and that it was then borrowed purely phoneti- cally as a substitute for a complex character meaning to peddle. This does not seem espe- cially convincing. Even less convincing is the obviously incoorrect but often heard explana- tion that 317 is a variant of tall/high 高 119, to the effect that it meant high plateau and that this name was given to dwellers of the high plains who were noted traders and who also became the Shang dynasty.

{"etymology":"Obscure. Once written []. []/[] is village 355. []/[] is not say []/言 274 but a CO character meaning spit. Its etymology is unclear, though [] is presumably mouth 20. There is some support for a view that [] is a variant of [], the old form of not [] (read FU) 572 q.v. The latter originally indicated a bud emerging from a whorl of leaves, and may thus indicate coming out, giving [] a meaning of that coming out of the mouth. It should be noted that in compounds [] often seems to be associated both with dividing and growing, both of which can be interpreted as derived meanings of [] though not, strictly speaking, of [] itself. It should also be noted that a combination of not and mouth definitely exists as the character deny 否 962 q.v, which literally means make the negating sound 'fu' with the mouth. Thus, if the [] part of [] is a variant of [], this would mean that [] is ipso facto a variant of 否, raising the possibility that spit similarly derives from making the sound 'fu' with the mouth. Unfortu- nately not only is the etymology of [] unclear, its role here (both semantic and/or phonetic) is also unclear. Some scholars claim that it lends a meaning of division, giving division or part of a village and hence clan. However, 384 is known to have once referred to a specific clan in China, thus suggesting that the clan was associated with a village called FU. From this point opinion is further divided, some scholars claiming that the meaning division and hence section/part is the result purely of borrowing or miscopy- ing (involving divide 剖 1813), while others take the village in question to be a division or part of a larger administrative district. Still others see it as a village of outcasts (from spit out/reject). Suggest taking [] as stand 73 and [] as (open) mouth. ",

The latter is a now defunct character meaning target range ([] being arrow 981 and [] being a leather curtain hung down to protect the judges, though some scholars feel it indicated the target itself) and by extension target. Thus [] is target person, meaning a person one wishes to meet/ greet. In the case of 478 a further person [] was added for clarity, while the bent per- son []/[] which originally seems to have applied to the person being met, came through its bent posture (apparently actually just a stylisation) to be taken as the person instigating the meeting, whose bent posture was taken as a symbol of humility. Thus at this stage 478 meant humbly await/request a meeting or visit. It can still mean request or greet (or await in Chinese), which all stem from this early meaning. In Japanese its use as a polite suffix and its meaning of serve also stem from its early connotations of hu- mility. Sign is an associated meaning, from the idea of having an audience with a superi- or, stating one's business, and watching for signs indicating the superior's response. In Japanese sign has extended to weather.

Other scholars take 青 to mean fresh/ pure and take 争 to mean stop/stay (from its assumed literal meaning of one arm stopping another), to give stay- ble lack of movement.

[] originally referred to holes in a cliffside, i.e. fissures or caves, but gradually came to mean just cliff. In an attempt to shift the focus back to the holes in the cliff the element [] was added. It technically shows a doubling of mouth/ say 口 20 and means noisy, but was used here for its idea of two openings (also 20) as well as for its sound, which like 敢 expressed gape. However, once again cliff came to pre- vail. Ironically, cliff is now conveyed by the NGU character [], which adds mountain 山 24, while 854 became used to express severe/ strict/ solemn instead of the NGU character [].

In any event, offer to a high authority came in time to mean report to a ruler, though it is not clear why that which was offered became nar- rowed to information. Play an instrument is felt by some scholars to be a borrowed meaning, by others to derive from the idea of a musical presentation for the benefit of a rul- er, and by still others to be an associated meaning, from the fact that the offering of tribute was generally accompanied by a fanfare of musical instruments.

{"etymology":"Formerly []. 欠 is lack 471 q.v., here in its literal sense of gaping mouth. []/区 is ward/ section 465 q.v.

Here it is used to express the sound Ō. (Though as an independent character [] is now invariably read KU it is also listed as having a minor reading Ō, both readings appearing to stem from an original reading of YOKU/EOKU/EUKU or similar.) Thus to make the sound Ō (EO/EU) with a gaping mouth, a reference to groaning while vomiting. It can still be used to mean vomit in Chinese, while in Japanese this is expressed by the NGU character [], which uses an ordinary mouth 口 instead of gaping mouth 欠. The character was also chosen as the phonetic for the EU of Europe, as well as Eustachian, Euclid, etc. Why a character with such emitic connotations should be chosen to represent Europe is a matter of some conjecture. While it is true that there are very few characters with a reading of this particu- lar type of Ō(EU/EO, as opposed to OO, OU, etc.), it should be noted that there is a per- fectly good NGU character [] (言 is words 274), which is read Ō/EU/EO and has a meaning of praise/ extol.

In combination with tree 木 the meaning became tree that produces a string/ cluster of baby round things. The peach (see 1646) was one of the most commonest fruits, and the cherry was considered 'baby' relative to this. In Chinese 1036 is hardly used, but it is a popular character in Japanese. It should be noted that, despite the fact that 1036 was first applied to the cherry fruit, fruiting cherries appear to have become rare (certainly in Japan), and in Japanese it is now used almost exclusively of the flowering cherry.

In combination with the 'drive a cart' element [] (which confusingly only became drive a cart in combination with movement, since there is no cart element proper) this produced a meaning of stop (driving) a cart. This came to mean unload, which is its main meaning in Chinese. In Japanese there is a semantic over- lap between unloading a vehicle and selling wholesale (i.e. selling there and then at the roadside rather than through a retail outlet), with the verb orosu meaning both lower/ un- load and sell wholesale depending on the character (generally 下 7 is used for lower/ un- load). 1042 is also sometimes used to express a separate homophonic word orosu meaning to grate (vegetables), though this is normally express by 下 7.

Some scholars see its present meaning of friendship as an asso- ciation/ extension of earnest/ open statement, i.e. a situation in which there is no duplicity and only goodwill, while others see it as a borrowing. Engrave is likewise seen as a bor- rowing by some scholars, and by others as an alternative line of semantic evolution from the emphasised idea of open, leading to open up a hole and thus by association engrave (i.e. to make a groove). While the latter theory seems somewhat unlikely it should be noted that in Chinese 1108 can also mean empty/ hollow.

It is possible that in the latter case 奇 itself acts phonetically to express one-legged (as well as lending a meaning of strange), or else that leg [] was simply added to 奇 (assuming for argument's sake that this does mean one-legged) for clarity. However, it seems unlikely that a spoken word meaning one- legged existed, and more likely that 可 lent its connotations of twisted (and possibly also acted in some unclear phonetic role), giving either a person standing in a twisted fashion or else something greatly twisted. In view of the association betweeen twisted and odd (see 1041), the 'greatly twisted' theory seems the most likely.

{"etymology":"衣 is clothing 420.

It still retains this mean- ing in Chinese, and in Japanese is very occasionally used in the associated sense of wearing double layers of clothing. It is not clear why such a complex character was chosen as a phonetic. The idea of religious ritual led to ritual and convention in a broad sense, and eventually to the associated idea of inheriting (something from the past). Attack stems from confusion with a now defunct character [], which combines clothing 衣 with grasp 執 1332 and originally meant grapple/ scuffle. ",

It is not clear how (snarling?) guard dog came to mean beast.

Note also that 荘 is often interchanged with its principal component manly 壮 1514 q.v., which has an assumed literal meaning of erect male organ in bed (male organ 士 494 and bed [] 1389) and thus strong sexual connotations. 壮 is itself the 'male equivalent' of [], a CO character literally meaning woman in bed (woman 女 35 and bed []/[] 1389) which is also interchangeable in Chi- nese with 1406. Thus originally 1406 clearly had strong connotations of making oneself up with a specific view to increasing sexual allure, though nowadays it is usually used in a general esthetic sense.

Though confusingly 1414 does nowadays usually refer to a large and unwieldy type of bell, the latter theory seems the more likely. Evidence for this includes the fact that 1313 is interchangeable with an NGU character 鉦, which uses SHŌ correct 正 41 in an apparently similar phonetic role, and the fact that there exists a CO character [], which usees heavy 重 311 (also once pronounced SHŌ and sometimes interchanged with 童 [see 1411]) in a similar role, though it actually means large goblet rather than bell (i.e. handle becoming interpreted as stem).

Some scholars take surplus to be a borrowed meaning, while others see it as an extended meaning, either from the idea of giving away surplus items or the idea of giving items away with excessive generosity. In any event, the theory that 剰 is a simplification/ miscopying of [] is by no means con- vincing. The forms are too distinct for a miscopying or deliberate variation to be likely, and [] is too complex to be used as a simplification. It seems more likely that 剰 did exist as a primitive character in its own right, but that no primitive forms have yet been discovered. A possible explanation of its etymology might be that [] meant cut (away), with 乗 act- ing phonetically to express surplus/ superfluous (see 1416) and possibly also lending supporting connotations of extremity (from its original connotations of treetop).

Certainly 1553 has long had a core meaning of high, with prominent/ excellent being an associated meaning. The meaning of []/[] is un- known. At one stage it was written [], suggesting a variant of slumped figure [] 238, and this has led to a theory that it indicated a lame person (reinforced by the fact that the pronunciation of 早 was the same as that of a word for cripple). Lame person is said to have symbolised leaning and unevenness, with the latter eventually leading by association to height. This does not seem at all convincing, though it is a theory favored by authorita- tive Japanese scholars. In any event, table is categorically a borrowed meaning. Specifi- cally, 1553 was borrowed as a simpler version of the NGU character []. This combines high 卓 with wood 木 69 (here meaning wooden item) to give high wooden item, a refer- ence to a table.

[] is roof/ house 28, but otherwise the etymol- ogy of []/[] is rather obscure. It appears to use different elements at different stages. The earliest forms such as [] show [], which is believed to be a variant of twisting weed []/[] 281 q.v. and may have acted symbolically to indicate reaching and stop- ping (from its characteristic of reaching the surface and then stopping -- see the parallel version of foot []/正 129 q.v./ 41, possibly in its meaning of stopping and thus being similar to stopping/ inverted foot [] 438 q.v. and giving a similar character to guest/ visi- tor 客 252 q.v. Note however that there is a CO character [] meaning curtain/ hidden/ protected (of unclear etymology, but possibly itselef a version of foot 止/[] -- see also 1805), and it is possible that []/[] derives from this, to give a literal meaning to []/[] such as person protected under a roof. In any event, in the case of 1744 []/[] is known to have acted phonetically to express display, and probably also orginally lent connotations of visitor. 1744 originally referred to displaying shells/ valuable items (believed to have been literally shells at first, as these were primitive symbols of wealth and ostentation, but later valuable items in general), probably on the occasion of a visit to one's home. It later came to mean display in a broader sense, but at a still later stage became confused with guest/ visitor []/[] and eventually replaced this (despite being the more complex of the two).

Thus ripples which cross the head, a reference to wrinkles (and by association frown). However, the strong presence of 渉 led to [] also being used to mean cross water, and thus at one stage [] meant both wrinkles and cross water. Water [] was then removed to distin- guish between the meanings, with the 'waterless' 頻 being used to represent wrinkles while [] developed its acquired meaning of cross water, eventually coming by associa- tion to mean shore/ verge. It is not fully clear how 頻 then came to mean frequently. Some scholars feel it is a borrowed meaning, but it seems equally likely to be an associated meaning with wrinkle through a linking concept of many/ numerous. Confusingly, 頻 is still very occasionally interchanged with [] to mean shore. It is now used only rarely to mean wrinkles/ frown, this meaning having been largely assumed by an NGU characgter [] which adds lowly 卑 1727 (the role of the latter unclear). ",

[] is an NGU character meaning sorceress/ shamaness/ tem- ple maiden (etymology unclear, but an old form [] suggests people []/[] 39 at work 工 113). 1923 origginally referred to a shamaness in a state of possession, i.e. with the gods/ spirits having descended upon her from heaven. By association it came to refer to the spirits themselves. (Note that gods and spirits/ souls of the dead conceptually overlap as a result of ancestor worship.) Suggest taking [] as rain 2 and [] as a variant of line (up) 並 1775. ",

"隷":
{"etymology":"Formerly also []. [] is seize by the tail 1547, here meaning simply seize/ obtain. []/[] is the rather awkward supplication to the gods/ earnest wish element seen in 1108 q.v., here acting phonetically to express pledge but of unclear semantic role. 1924 origi- nally meant to obtain something pledged (i.e. pawned). It came to refer in particular to obtaining a pledged slave, partly because []/[] could also phonetically express bind and by association bound person/ slave, and eventually 1924 came to refer to the slave himself/ herself. Prisoner is an associated meaning with slave/ bound person. Suggest taking [] as samurai 士 494 and show 示 695. ",

It came to acquire the lesser meaning of angle/ angular as a re- sult of being used instead of a now defunct character [], which shows stone/ rock 石 45 and combine 兼 and presumably originally meant assemblage of rocks or similar (with an- gular being an associated meaning).

{"etymology":"Formerly []. 火 is fire 8. [] is an NGU character confusingly listed (without illustra- tion) as meaning hut, but in Chinese it has a range of meanings centered on receptacle/ container. It comprises dish/ vessel 皿 1307, basket [] 399 (now usually [] -- see also 1757), and tiger [] 281. The role of tiger [] is not clear, but vessel 皿 and basket [] clearly indicate containers. Thus fire container, i.e. hearth and later furnace.

It is not fully clear how it also came to mean revel/ make open. This does not seem to be a borrowing, and is believed to stem from the idea of dew appearing openly for all to see. 1935 was later borrowed for its sound to refer to Russia. ",

"郎":
{"etymology":"Formerly []. [] is village 355. []/良 is good 598. 1936 was originally used as a proper noun to refer to a certain village in ancient China (literally Good Village). Its preseent meanings result from its being used as an expedient simplification of the term 良人. This combines good 良 with person [] 39 and was used by women to address their hus- band.

{"etymology":"心 is heard/ feelings 147. [] is a certain 809 q.v., here acting phonetically to express doubt but of unclear semantic role. Confusingly, [] normally means delineated area, which might be felt to suggest the opposite of doubt/ uncertainty, but since it technically means roughly delineated area (from the idea of crude markers -- see also 698) it may pos- sibly focus on the idea of knowing something approximately but not with absolute certain- ty. Nevertheless, its choice as a phonetic seems very inappropriate. Thus doubt in the heart/ feelings of doubt, leading by association to confusion.

[] is an NGU character now used to mean addressed to, but in Chinese it can mean bending, soft, yield, and obliging/ polite (the latter clearly a figurative associa- tion with yielding, and presumably leading by further association to addressed to). It com- prises roof/ house [] 28 and [], which is a CO character meaning turn in one's sleep (night 夕 44 and slumped/ bent body [] 768). [] may have originally been merely an embellished variant of [], meaning turn in one's sleep at home, but it clearly had domi- nant connotations of bending the body. Confusingly, in the case of 1945 [] acts pho- netically to express straighten, but also lends its meaning of bent. Thus [] means to straighten a bent arm, while 腕 means straighten a bent body. This came to sym- bolise a display of strength, either in pushing or lifting, and hence came to mean both strong arm and ability. It is now also used of arm in a general sense. ",
