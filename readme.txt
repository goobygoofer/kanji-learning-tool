 -kanji
 -meaning
 -etymology
 -mnemonic
 -readings
 -all kanji referenced in the etymology

-ancient characters and chinese characters omitted
 (if you see empty brackets, these are either of those,
 either they couldn't be typed or were CO characters)
 This is meant to be a quick reference and not a 
 substitute to the actual book.

-to search a kanji, either type it in the search bar
 or click through the left and right arrows (wraps around)

-this is not an exhaustive list of kanji, it is only the
 1945 joyou kanji
